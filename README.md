This project contains the 3 individual applications that return hardcoded reply on http request.

Import these projects in Eclipse Java EE and add Tomcat server. Then click on run and select java application and then select the class name of main function.

Repeat it for 3 applications. 

Try requests

http://localhost:8081/catalog/foo

http://localhost:8082/movies/foo

http://localhost:8083/ratingsdata/foo


whatever be the last word tey return the same hard coded output.
